# DucksIncoming

Hey nerds, my name's Ricky (You can call me either Ricky or Ducks or whatever I don't have a preference). I'm a programmer/engineer that focuses on generally smaller, personal projects that center around some idea that interests me. I enjoy video editing, graphic design, 3D modeling and printing, and more. I try to diversify my hobbies and interests across a variety of disciplines, however my main focus is programming and engineering.

I use VSCode for all my programming and pyfirmata to interface with arduino stuff. Python is my favorite programming language and I will fight anyone who disagrees (Rust users leave now you're not gonna like my spaghetti code). I use Blender for 3D modeling, Chitubox for slicing for my 3D printer, Adobe Premiere for editing, and Photoshop and Paint.net for graphic design. 

Typically, everything I make is open source. If you see me making commits in any private repos, then they probably have some personal info about me or someone I know. It might be my portfolio or a personal project for someone I know, but as a general rule any public projects I make will be public on here.

(Any pronouns)
