# DucksIncoming

Hey nerds, my name's Ricky (You can call me either Ricky or Ducks or whatever I don't have a preference). I'm a programmer/engineer that focuses on generally smaller, personal projects that center around some idea that interests me. I enjoy video editing, graphic design, 3D modeling and printing, and more. I try to diversify my hobbies and interests across a variety of disciplines, however my main focus is programming and engineering.

I use VSCode for all my programming and pyfirmata to interface with arduino stuff. I use Blender for 3D modeling, Chitubox for slicing for my 3D printer, Adobe Premiere for editing, and Photoshop and Paint.net for graphic design. 

*Pronouns are he/him but I'm good with any*
