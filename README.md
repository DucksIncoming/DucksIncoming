Hey nerds, my name's Ricky, I'm a mechanical engineer that focuses on generally smaller, personal projects that center around some idea that interests me. I like video editing, graphic design, 3D modeling and printing, making music, and more. I try to diversify my hobbies and interests across a variety of disciplines, however my main focuses are programming and engineering.

I use VSCode for most of my programming and usually pyfirmata to interface with arduino stuff. Python is my favorite programming language and I will fight anyone who disagrees (Rust users leave now or reading my garbage code may kill you). I use Blender for 3D modeling, PrusaSlicer for slicing for my 3D printer, Adobe Premiere for editing, and Photoshop and Paint.net for graphic design. 

Typically, everything I make is open source. If you see me making commits in any private repos, then they probably have some personal info about me or someone I know, but as a general rule any public projects I make will be public on here.

Also, I use any pronouns :D
